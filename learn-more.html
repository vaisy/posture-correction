            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                Like most things in life, the key to good health is balance and homeostasis. As bi-pedal creatures, it is therefore paramount our delicate spine's are perfectly aligned. Most other creatures are quadrupeds (four legged) or more. This makes them more stable
                and less prone to some of the injuries that we as humans suffer.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Think of it this way; would you sit on a chair with 2 legs or 4 legs? Which is more stable? Our bi-pedal nature creates torque and twisting forces on our spine as we move. This is just mechanical physics. Over time these forces take their toll on us.
                <p>
                    Here's another analogy; Ever heard the phrase...'you don't build your house on sand'? Sand is poor ground to build foundations upon for any building as it's walls and frame would move around and eventually fall apart. Similarly if your body frame (skeleton)
                    is crooked or misaligned things just won't function properly and YOU begin to fall apart also. This misalignment or 'bones out of place in a direction the body cannot self correct because there are no bones pulling in the direction
                    needed' is the root to almost all your health problems that are not cancer, infection or diabetes etc.
                </p>

                <p>In his book; The Power of Posture', Naudi Aguilar highlights how he came to realise the importance of posture. I myself used it as a source for much of my own efforts to get my body well. The MFR (myofascial release) techniques were most
                    helpful in rediscovering lost mobility. Although as I say the techniques helped some, they eventually became futile in the long run as, like most methods they failed to acknowledge the fundamental problem that only ABC actually tackles.</p>

                        What is ABC™?
                    </h1>
                </div>
                <p>As per ABCA (Advanced BioStructural Correction Australasia); Advanced Biostructural Correction™ is a full-body, manual protocol-based method of correcting and optimising the biomechanics of the human skeletal framework. Aimed at detecting
                    and correcting biomechanical misalignments that the body cannot self-correct as there is no muscle (or combination of muscles) that can pull in the direction needed. When this occurs our body “twists”, or uses other muscles pulling
                    in other directions, to compensate.</p>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img class="img-twists" src="/img/twists.jpg">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Over time, with many such misalignments and compensatory twists posture deteriorates and symptoms can develop. These symptoms cover the myriad of conditions seen daily in chiropractic practice. The importance of posture should not be underestimated.
                    “Observation of the striking influence of postural mechanics on function and symptomatology have led to our hypothesis that posture affects and moderates every physiologic function from breathing to normal hormonal production. Spinal
                    pain, headache, mood, blood pressure, pulse, and lung capacity are among the functions most easily influenced by posture.”
                    <br><i>–American Journal of Pain Management 1994, 4: 36-39</i></p>
                <p>
                    When correctly applied, ABC™ practitioners world-wide frequently observe consistent and predictable improvements in postural stability, marked by the ability of the patient’s body to stay more “effortlessly upright”. Due to the influence of postural balance
                    on human physiology and function, patients frequently report improvements in other areas, such as pain levels, improved mobility and ease of breathing.

                <i>Excerpts taken from www.meningealrelease.com</i>
                <br>
                <p>When people first started noticing that bones out of place caused problems with health, they noticed that some spinal bones (called vertebra) appeared to be out of place backwards. The concept was simple. Find the bone that’s backwards
                    and, with a person face down on a table, push it forward. It seemed to make sense and that has been the theory behind most methods of manipulation since the beginning — even going back thousands of years to ancient methods used in
                    India and China and especially in more modern times, with methods developed in chiropractic, osteopathy, physical therapy and others.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img class="img-skeleton" src="/img/skeleton.gif">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>In the animation notice that the person is face down. Notice the two misaligned bones in the center of the spine. One is clearly forward and one is relatively backward. What is taught is to push the backward bone forward (the blue arrow
                    coming down — a typical chiropractic, osteopathic and physical therapy treatment and widely taught in all their schools and by most independent teachers). At the end of the treatment notice that rather than being lined up correctly
                    there are now two bones stuck forward. This is why people continue to slump. With Advanced BioStructural Correction™ you will see that changes immediately. Bodies immediately are more upright with no physical effort.</p>
                <p>
                    That backward vertebra, before treatment, will often feel stuck, swollen and tender to both the practitioner and the patient. Pushing this area of the spine forward, though painful for a second or so during the treatment, often leaves the patient feeling
                    better at that spot because it unsticks the bones. However, the bones have been pushed more forward overall. If you ask that person to let their body relax, you will find they now fall more forward at that spot.
                </p>
                <p>Practitioners put people face down and push on their backs all the time. So do massage therapists even though they don’t thrust. Many exercises and stretches by physical therapists have the exact same effect on their patients bodies of
                    pushing bones forward.</p>
                <p>
                    If you’re in a profession where you touch people’s backs then you know that some people have very healthy, flexible spines, but most do not. You also know that in the same person some areas of their spine move really well and other areas feel like tree
                    trunks. Treatment goals usually involve manipulation of these stuck joints to free them up or strengthening and stretching of tight muscles that are causing the person pain.
                </p>
                <p>So how does Advanced BioStructural Correction™ take a completely different approach to healing?</p>
                <p>What would happen if instead of pushing forward on the bone that was backwards, you could push the bone stuck forward backwards? Would that have a different outcome? How would you even get to the bone to push it backwards? You clearly
                    couldn’t pull it backwards because there’s nothing to grab hold of right?</p>
                <br>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img class="img-man-skeleton" src="/img/man-with-skeleton.gif">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>Take a look at the animation. The same bones are forward and backward on this patient. To get the forward bone to move backward into the correct position the practitioner creates a fulcrum using a fist. Putting the fist below the vertebra
                    that is forward creates a fulcrum that can be used to lever the forward bone backward if you push on the front of the body. You have to be careful not to push too hard because the fulcrum is the same vertebra that appears backwards
                    in the above animation. If you push too hard you might get the forward one to move backward, but you might also get the backward one to move forward.</p>
                <p>The standing patient wraps their arms around their body and from the front the practitioner stands close in front of the patient, asks the patient to relax and adjusts the person against the wall. In this position, the force comes from
                    the front, through the ribs and to the forward vertebra which pushes it backwards. Very different wouldn’t you say?
                    <p>Which version is right? In both cases the practitioner is moving bones and probably getting some audible crackling noises out of the joints. But which version would you want for yourself? You’re probably saying, “The one that works.”
                        And I would agree.</p>
                    <p>However, what does “works” mean? Are we just interested in relieving pain temporarily? Can one get relief from pain but make the body mechanically worse — adversely affecting breathing or movement in other parts of the body? These
                        are things to consider beyond the pain that most people miss because they are so focused on getting relief from the pain. It is also why many use drugs. They know drugs do not change the body and might be harmful, but they do relieve
                        the pain.
                        <p>Turns out that if vertebra get shoved forward there are no muscles or groups of muscles that can pull the bone backwards. So why would you ever want to shove them forward purposely even if it helped reduce pain?</p>
                        <p>Forward is the enemy. This is the same reason you see the elderly bent forward. Have you ever wondered why there are no walkers for people that are bent backwards or to the right or left? Why are the walkers designed for people
                            that are bent forward only? It’s because you never see people any other way. They are always forward. And now you know why. As more and more bones get pushed forward in a person over a lifetime, from common everyday activities,
                            they get more stooped forward and can’t stand up straight…Even if they try.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>Advanced BioStructural Correction™ (ABC™) addresses this sole issue. ABC™ corrects bones out of place that your body cannot self correct because there is no muscle or group of muscles that actually exist in the human body that
                            can correct these malpositions. This is one of the huge factors that have been missing in health care. ABC™ has figured out every single bone in the body that has this “defect”, if you want to call it that, where the bone cannot
                            self correct in every direction. The other factor that is critical in correcting bodies is meningeal releases.</p>
                        <p>Together by releasing the meninges and correcting ONLY the bones out of place that the body cannot self correct that day can the body unwind and almost go backwards through time reversing old injuries and restoring health like
                            nothing else can.</p>
                        <h1>How and Why Does ABC™ Work?</h1>
                        <p>This will be the question on the lips of all the sceptics, me included, before of course I started getting treated and became a practitioner. We have already talked about the fundamental discovery of bones out of place that cannot
                            self correct, but now we will see what this really means.</p>
