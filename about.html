                Body Centric Wellness is a private healthcare provider specialising in delivering a revolutionary corrective technique known as Advanced BioStructural Correction.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Here at Body Centric Wellness you and your body's well-being are at the centre of our attention. The clinic's goal is to help you restore your body's health you thought was lost.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                We specialise in the application of a highly advanced technique known as Advanced BioStructural Correction&#8482;. This technique, courtesy of Dr Jesse Jutkowitz, is helping people worldwide take back control of their health and live their lives. You
                no longer have to settle for pain and misery and can continue doing the things you always enjoyed doing, as you will begin to discover.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                It is operated by myself, your certified practitioner, Mohammed Jibran and is the culmination of years of research into how I could improve my health and well-being.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                I came across ABC, like most great historical discoveries, by accident. As my own health gradually deteriorated over the years I was forced into giving up the two loves of my youth; football and weight lifting. Despite being active and following a reasonably
                healthy lifestyle I kept getting niggling injuries and all too often would fall ill. My doctors could not provide satisfactory answers and would try to convince to just accept my situation. Growing ever frustrated with the standard of
                healthcare knowledge and practice I took the matter of my health into my own hands and began heavily researching whatever was ailing me. Despite my efforts I couldn't make much head ground. I tried cupping, stretching, MFR (myofascial
                release), diet changes, targeted exercises, isometric training...the list goes on. Although said techniques are not completely useless they only provide temporary symptom relief. Unfortunately they do not tackle the cause of the symptom.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Understanding this I delved deeper into the subject of how the body works and what makes it go wrong.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
                The final straw for me was when Doctors admitted they could not help my son(s), who also suffer from various health issues. Their plights provided the final impetus to desperately search for a solution that could at least give them some feeling of normality
                i.e. being able to walk around like other kids.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Through my searching I learnt the importance of posture. However my understanding of it was immature. I, like most others, thought it was related to your muscles and movement so introduced some of the previously mentioned techniques. I was not aware that
                your body should stay upright with perfect posture all by itself, provided everything was aligned correctly. This discovery lead me to ABC&#8482; and the rest as they say is history. I was so impressed by the technique and it's effectiveness
                I decided to train and become a practitioner myself.
